==== v x.y.z ====
* Updated HiVe.im (WIP).
  -- login works, however, a premium account is required for further testing, since the host has disabled free accounts and only allows trials (which don't really work).
  -- furthermore, there are rumors that all files uploaded to this file-host can only be downloaded if the recipient is logged into their website.
  -- for these reasons, further development of this plugin has been suspended indefinitely, until someone provides a premium account for testing (for just a couple of hours).
  -- this plugin currently only supports accounts created with Hive itself. oAuth based authentication (using Google and the like) is therefore, not supported.

* Feature : All successful uploads are written in

  As per user mailseb's request in the NU forums.
* Changed the translation system. Now it is simpler.
  Now java interfaces are mapped to strings, instead of strings to strings.
  This avoids spelling mistakes, and also allows easy checking
  of default values, and also variable usage (using netbeans)

  one or more lines.

  PoolingClientConnectionManager.leaseConnection
* Created a tool which automatically generates translations for
  untranslated strings using google translate. (My sincere gratitude to Google).
  Machine (Google) translated strings are marked (g).
  (g) means these strings have not been checked by human for sanity.
  Some google translations are total nonsense. We have no clue
  of what google has done. So to let users know, these have been
  marked as (g).

  been done. In total 67 language translations are hence available.
